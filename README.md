# Express Server

This project contains a Node.js server implemented in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the Node.js server using Docker, follow these steps:

- Build and start the Docker containers by running the following command:

  ```shell
  docker compose up
  ```

  This command will build the Docker image for the Node.js server and start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- The Node.js server should now be running. You can access it at port `8001`.
